# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

- I was able to view the videos listed on the Todo checklist, set up an AWS free tier account, create an IAM user and implement an additional layer of security by setting up a MFA. 

- Furthermore, I understand how to work with AWS cloudShell and AWS billing reports. I was able to create a billing alert and a budget to monitor my monthly cost.

- I took time to understand the architectural diagram of what we plan to build in this bootcamp and also created a replica of the architectural diagram using Lucid chart, [Link](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/4e3f1939-70e0-4b53-becb-d20dd2b26cda/image.jpeg).
