# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- I was able to view the videos listed on the Todo checklist; how to ask for Technical help, week 1-live streamed and learnt the importance of container security and best practices.

- Furthermore, I understand how to containerise an application with Dockerfile and Docker Compose. I was able to work with OpenAI for endpoint notification and also wrote a Flask Backend Endpoint Notifications and React page Notifications. 

- I took time to understand how to run DynamoDB local container and Postgres container (and ensured it worked perfectly).

- I was also able to run the Dockerfile CMD as an external script which was pushed and tag to my DockerHub account.

- In addition to that I learn how to install Docker on my local machine.
